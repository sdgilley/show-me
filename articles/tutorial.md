# Tutorial: Train your first ML model

This tutorial is **part two of a two-part tutorial series**. In the previous tutorial, you [created a workspace and chose a development environment](). In this tutorial, you learn the foundational design patterns in Azure Machine Learning, and train a simple scikit-learn model based on the diabetes data set. After completing this tutorial, you will have the practical knowledge of the SDK to scale up to developing more-complex experiments and workflows.

In this tutorial, you learn the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]

> * Connect your workspace and create an experiment
> * Load data and train scikit-learn models
> * View training results in the studio
> * Retrieve the best model

## Prerequisites

The only prerequisite is to run part one of this tutorial, [Setup environment and workspace]().

In this part of the tutorial, you run the code in the sample Jupyter notebook *tutorials/create-first-ml-experiment/tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-train.ipynb* opened at the end of part one. This article walks through the same code that is in the notebook.

## Open the notebook

> [!Important]
> Read the tutorial notebook below.  Or open the Jupyter notebook in your [studio workspace](https://ml.azure.com/) now if you want to run the code.

## Clean up resources

Do not complete this section if you plan on running other Azure Machine Learning tutorials.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you did the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]

> * Connected your workspace and created an experiment
> * Loaded data and trained scikit-learn models
> * Viewed training results in the studio and retrieved models
